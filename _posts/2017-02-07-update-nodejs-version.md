Node.js updates quickly. Fortunately, there are a ton of tools for updating Node.js easily.

1. nvm
2. n

Today, I'm gonna use `n` to update `Node.js`.

### 1. Install n
---

```bash
$ npm install -g n
```

</br>

---
### 2. Update Node.js to stable version
---

```bash
$ n stable
```

You can replace the `stable` with whataver version you want.

### 3. Check what versions are installed
---

```bash
$ n
```
